# HR Data Analysis Report
This Dataset which we analyzed is from the HR department of an organization. They need a detailed analysis about job satisfaction of their Employees and want to know the problems which employees face according to the previous data.
Basically this report is the result of gathering raw data from different sources, cleaning it afterwards and applying different rules & algorithms to understand more about the company. This dataset gives an insight about the employee salaries,salary hike, their perfomance rating and working duration in the company.
This report is meant for senior stakeholders mainly used at the end of fiscal year to understand where the company is going in terms of growth and any gender discrepancy with salary offering.

To run the code, please install "jupyter notebook" on your machine.
